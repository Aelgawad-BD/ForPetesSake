Class LTexture is just a wrapper around the SDL_Texture pointer used to load .png files on the screen

a scene would have more that one SDL_Texture rendered at the same time. This is made easier by the wrapper class, which keeps track and renders .png files

[proposed] Class character in the future wich would represent player, enemies, etc, would have a lot of attributes one of which would be an LTexture property
in fact multiple LTextures to account for different animation sprites

[proposed] For animation sprites, I'll go with one sheet for multiple animations. One row per animation sequence. It should be standardized across all characters
for example: the first row the character idle animation, second row is the walking animation etc. That way there is only one LTexture object per character and it
is always shown, as opposed to showing and hiding (or creating and killing objects) for different animations which I suspect wou;ld be slower. The other way is cleaner I
tjink, just have to be careful when SDL_Rect are scanning through the sprite sheet.

In the spirtit of OOP. I think the class LTexture should father two child classes SpriteSheet and StaticTexture classes

OPTION 1:
One design to consider for the Character, Texture relationship is:
- Entity has Texture (entity is an inanimate picture)
- Character inherits Entity
- Character has Texture (bt default)
- Character implements Animator
- Animator takes in (as a param, or however) the texture file, which in this case should be a sprite sheet and manages the animation, so it would support functions like RenderWalkAnimation() or Move(right)

OPTION 2:
Another Design to consider is to have the LTexture class handle animation by itself, it would figure out if object is animate or not, and have a whole bunch of functions that only work for sprite sheets like RenderWalkAnimation() or Move(right)


Created a SPriteSheet class which handles all visiual aspects for an entity. SpriteSheet houses inside an array of Texture objects (currently 6) one Texture for each of the 6 animations. SpriteSheet DOESNOT inherit from Texture anymore.

If it is an animate object aka Character it has SpriteSheet else it has a Texture
