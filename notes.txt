Class LTexture is just a wrapper around the SDL_Texture pointer used to load .png files on the screen

a scene would have more that one SDL_Texture rendered at the same time. This is made easier by the wrapper class, which keeps track and renders .png files

[proposed] Class character in the future wich would represent player, enemies, etc, would have a lot of attributes one of which would be an LTexture property
in fact multiple LTextures to account for different animation sprites

[proposed] For animation sprites, I'll go with one sheet for multiple animations. One row per animation sequence. It should be standardized across all characters
for example: the first row the character idle animation, second row is the walking animation etc. That way there is only one LTexture object per character and it
is always shown, as opposed to showing and hiding (or creating and killing objects) for different animations which I suspect wou;ld be slower. The other way is cleaner I
tjink, just have to be careful when SDL_Rect are scanning through the sprite sheet.

In the spirtit of OOP. I think the class LTexture should father two child classes SpriteSheet and StaticTexture classes
